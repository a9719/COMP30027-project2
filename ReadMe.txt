The goal of this Project is to build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning methods, to predict star ratings (1, 3, or 5) for reviews on restaurants. More information about the project can be found in the specifications.


To Run this python file successfully just change the path according to the address on your machine for all three doc2vec and review_text_train.csv, review_meta_train.csv and review_text_test.csv

When running i have hashtagged the code which saves it the test ratings as csv but if you want them just unhash them

MLP - resultmlp1.csv

MultnomialNB- resultmultinomial.csv

SGDclassifier - resultsgd.csv
